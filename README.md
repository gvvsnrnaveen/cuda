### This is not official Nvidia Cuda Toolkit repository, nor it is associated with Nvidia ###
### you are free to use any of these samples in your work, if found helpful kindly mention my github reference in your license ###

This repository provides the very simple to understand programming samples to learn/work with Cuda Toolkit on Nvidia GPUs

Following are the samples and their description

1. 001_basic_vector_addition - This program gives the basic vector addition with a constant value
2. 002_vector_arithmetic - This program gives the arithmetic operations of vectors (c = a + b,  c = a - b, c = a * b, c = b / a)
3. 003_timing_measurement - This program gives the details of performance measurements in CUDA
4. 004_concurrent_kernels - This program gives the implementation details of concurrency and concurrent kernels - HtoD Memcpy, Kernel Execution, DtoH Memcpy concurrency
5. 005_async_api - This program gives the implementation of async memcpy and synchronization using events
6. 006_assert - This program gives the implementation of using assertions in CUDA kernels
7. 007_fatbin_kernels - This program gives the implementation of using external CUDA kernels as fatbin files in custom programs
